# Stock-Model-Predictions
Written by: Anthony Krenek 

I am trying to predict the stock prices of 2 stocks (can be any two stocks I used GD and NOC). Using Linear Regression on testing and training a model to predict the stock prices for the future. 

I have always wanted to make some sort of model that will predict stock prices for companies. Able to use any S&P 500 Company
yfinance allows you to scrape the data from within the python file which I thought was super cool

Libraries for Finding Data: 
yfinance as yf 
pandas as pd 


Goals: 
Be able to find somewhat accurate predictions for companies by succesfully using Linear Regression
Find helpful trends in the stocks data 
Learn more about Machine Learning

I will continue to update this repository when I finish more!
